    Runs one outer SMC delayed-acceptance step.

    The function first checks whether the sampler should continue.
    If the sampler is still active, it performs one SMC update.

    The active update has four main parts.
    First, particles are reweighted and beta is updated.
    Second, geometry is fitted from the weighted particles.
    Third, particles are resampled.
    Fourth, particles are mutated with the chosen mutation kernel.

    If the sampler is no longer active, the carry is returned unchanged.
    In that case, the statistics are marked as inactive.

    Parameters:

        It contains the random key, particles, geometry, ESS state,
