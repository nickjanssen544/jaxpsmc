## **Package description**
---

`jaxpsmc` implements a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler in JAX for Bayesian posterior approximation and marginal-likelihood estimation. The implementation follows the standard SMC construction: it represents the target distribution by a set of weighted particles, introduces a sequence of intermediate distributions between prior and posterior, and applies reweighting, resampling, and mutation to control weight degeneracy while transporting the particle population toward the posterior.

The sampler evolves particles along a temperature-annealed sequence of intermediate distributions, beginning at the prior and ending at the posterior. This allows the sampler to explore effectively difficult targets, especially when the posterior is multimodal. At small $\beta$, the likelihood is flattened and the particles explore a broader approximation to the posterior geometry; as $\beta$ increases, the distribution contracts toward the true posterior. The sampler is intended for nonlinear geometry, bounded coordinates, periodic or reflective parameters, and posteriors with well-separated modes.

At the algorithmic level, `jaxpsmc` consists of the following components.

1. **Reweighting:** at a proposed inverse temperature $\beta_t$, the algorithm updates particle weights using the likelihood increment, evaluates either the effective sample size or the unique sample size, and then selects the next temperature by bisection so that the chosen degeneracy criterion remains close to a target. This makes the annealing steps data-adaptive.

2. **Resampling:** after reweighting, the weighted particle set is resampled using either multinomial or systematic resampling. This prevents the approximation from collapsing onto a small number of particles with large weight. 

3. **Mutation:** the current implementation mutates the active particles using a t-preconditioned Crank-Nicolson kernel in latent space. This is the stage at which local exploration occurs. It is also the stage at which preconditioning takes place: if the target can be mapped to a space with less correlated structure, even a simple local proposal can become substantially more effective. Integrating a normalizing flow for preconditioning is still work in progress, and the current implementation uses an identity flow.


## **Examples**
---

There are two examples.

1. **Numerical experiments:** this example constructs synthetic Gaussian-mixture targets with user-controlled dimension, number of mixture components, component means, component covariances, and mixture weights. The target likelihood is known exactly and can be evaluated directly, which makes the example suitable for checking whether the sampler behaves correctly on multimodal continuous distributions with nontrivial geometry.

2. **Gravitational-wave validation:** this example uses LIGO detector data for the GW150914 event and sets up an inference problem with a frequency-domain waveform model, detector PSD estimation, physically structured priors, and deterministic transforms from physical parameters to an unconstrained sampling space.
